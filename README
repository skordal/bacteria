Bacteria README
###############

Bacteria is a simple bacteria simulator. It was created on a train ride in
2009, and is meant to be somewhat entertaining to watch; therefore it has
absolutely nothing to do with science.

You can, however, graph the bacteria and food populations, using the
plot_data.p GnuPlot script.

Please note that the code is still undergoing revisions, as the code was pretty
messy to begin with; the application should, however, build and run without
trouble.

Any bugs you encounter should be reported on http://github.com/skordal/bacteria.
