Bacteria README
###############

Bacteria is a simple bacteria simulator. It was created on a train ride in
2009, and is meant to be somewhat entertaining to watch; therefore it has
absolutely nothing to do with science.

You can, however, graph the bacteria and food populations, using the
plot_data.p GnuPlot script.

Bacteria started out as a quick hack, and it is pretty obvious looking at the
code that it is still a wonder that it works as well as it does. However, it is
undergoing constant maintenance to bring it up to date and make it more C++-
like. Look out for const_casts and other weird stuff; this will be improved!

Any bugs you encounter should be reported on http://github.com/skordal/bacteria.
