Creating configuration files for Bacteria
#########################################

The configuration file for bacteria is in the following format:
	<key name> = <key value>

A line that starts with a '#' is considered a comment and ignored. Blank lines
are also ignored.

Some settings may also be specified on the command line. For the time beeing,
these settings does not override the settings specified in configuration files.

There is a datatype associated with every key. Thus, a key cannot be assigned
a value of another datatype than the one it has associated with itself. Here
is a list of key names, default values and datatypes:

See how to add new configuration keys at the bottom of this file.

StartingPopulation: Initial number of bacteria
	Data type: Integer
	Default value: 10

StartingFood: Initial number of food nuggets
	Data type: Integer
	Default value: 10

BacteriaStartingEnergy: The initial energy of bacteria
	Data type: Integer
	Default value: 0
	NOTE:
		The default value of 0 causes the bacteria to have an initial
		energy of FramesPerSecond * (12 Â± 6). This value would be more
		realistic until a better solution for the plus-minus issue is
		found.

FramesPerSecond: Number of frames per second
	Data type: Integer
	Default value: 25

FoodSmellingDistance: The distance from a food nugget at which a bacteria sees it
	Data type: Floating point number
	Default value: 50.000

FoodEnergy: The amount of energy quantas contained in each food nugget
	Data type: Integer
	Default value: 800

ReproductionEnergy: The energy at which a cell divides
	Data type: Integer
	Default value: 500

FeedingEnergy: The energy a bacteria gains each frame when feeding
	Data type: Integer
	Default value: 6

FoodSpawningRate: The rate at which new food is spawning (once every x frames)
	Data type: Integer
	Default value: 50

DatalogFilename: The file to which population data is logged
	Data type: String
	Default value: graph_data.dat

LoggerUpdateInterval: Milliseconds between each log entry
	Data type: Integer
	Default value: 100

GrowthRateSamplingInterval: How often to sample the population for calculating the
	                    average growth rate (samples/second).
	Data type: Integer
	Default value: 1

SHMFilename: Which file to open for SHM export of statistics.
	Data type: String
	Default value: /bacteria_stats

ScreenWidth: The width of the simulator window.
	Data type: Integer
	Default value: 800

ScreenHeight: The height of the simulator window.
	Data type: Integer
	Default value: 600

Fullscreen: Whether to run fullscreen or not.
	Data type: Boolean
	Default value: false

Steps to add a new configuration key:
	1. Find a default value and define it in config.h
	2. Add an entry to the table of default config values in default_config.h.
	   The following macros are used for this purpose:
	   	CFG_INT(name, value)
		CFG_BOOL(name, value)
		CFG_STRING(name, value)
		CFG_FLOAT(name, value)
	   These macros are defined in macros.h
	3. Add an entry to the table of value data types in default_config.h. The
	   following macro are used for this purpose:
	   	CFG_TYPE(name, type)
	   where name is the name of the key, and type is one of the following:
	   	INTEGER, FLOAT, BOOLEAN, STRING
	4. Add an entry to this file, in the format of the entries above.
	5. Optionally add an entry to the default config file, so as to have a complete
	   configuration file that users may derive their own from.
