Bacteria Quickstart Guide
#########################

Step 1:
	Start the application.

Step 2:
	Watch your little bacteria colony grow and thrive as your little bacteria
	eats and reproduces. Eventually they will not manage to find any food and die.
	That's life. Should this happen and you become sad, exit the application and
	repeat step 1.

Step 3:
	Install GnuPlot and run the script plot_graph.p. A graph will display
	the population of bacteria vs. the amount of food. This script will
	only work if you have not changed the default output file for the graph
	data.

Step 4:
	Repeat 1-3 as neccessary and report any bugs encountered on
	<http://github.com/skordal/bacteria/issues>.
