Bacteria Quickstart Guide
#########################

Step 1:
	Start the programme. If you want it to start without a GUI, pass the
	command line argument --no-gui. Note that it will still require X to
	be running due to SDL's dependence on it.

Step 2:
	Watch (alternatively through Paramecium) your little bacteria colony
	grow and thrive as your little bacteria eats and reproduces.
	Eventually they will manage to not find any food and die. That's life.
	Should this happen and you become sad, repeat step 1.

Step 3:
	Install GnuPlot and run the script plot_graph.p. A graph will display
	the population of bacteria vs. the amount of food. This script will
	only work if you have not changed the default output file for the graph
	data.

Step 4:
	Repeat 1-3 as neccessary. Report bugs to kristian.skordal@gmail.com.
